I intend for this page to eventually be broken out into subcategories in the style of https://carol.gg/links/ and https://www.m19y.dev/random/cool-sites/, but there is some cleanup work I need to do in my [[Lab#Karakeep (Formerly Hoarder)]] instance for that to happen. For now, I've dumped a bunch of links into one giant bucket.


<div class="rich-link-card-container">
    <a class="rich-link-card" href="https://hoarder.coder.cam/public/lists/sbmwyq3i5wrc3lfjgpoe5f66" target="_blank">
	    <div class="rich-link-image-container">
		    <div class="rich-link-image" style="background-image: url('https://hoarder.coder.cam/icon.png?a7a93df59b866555')">
	        </div>
	    </div>
	    <div class="rich-link-card-text">
		    <p class="rich-link-card-title">Public Links</p>
		    <p class="rich-link-card-description">
		        All Links I Think Others Should Know About
		    </p>
		    <p class="rich-link-href">

One of the features of Karakeep is that each of these lists can have it's own RSS link, so if you are interested to know when I add new links to those lists, you should subscribe there!
