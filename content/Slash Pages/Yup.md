Inspired by https://fyr.io/yep and I really tried not to make it just the opposites of everything on the [[Nope]] page, so perhaps they should be read together. I'll try to keep them both updated.

In no particular order:

# Will I...

- **be taking notes?** *Yup*, more than likely I'll be writing stuff down in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), because I have an awful memory.
- **check out your open source repo?** *Yup*, if for anything else I am always interested in how people solve problems, and I love open source software. 
- **support open access to information?** *Absolutely*, because information is power and [sharing isn't immoral â€” it's a moral imperative](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt)
- **pay for open source software?** *Yup*, because it isn't wrong to want to monetarily benefit from your work providing value to people, but let it be a direct payment and not in the form of ads or consistent nagging. [Let me pay for firefox](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/let-me-pay-for-firefox/141297)
- **hold a grudge?** *Yup*, and I'm not proud of it. It's one of my worst and certainly most toxic traits. People deserve opportunities to be better and grow, and Lord knows I've been blessed with my share of such opportunities from people I love and have hurt. Despite counting those blessings, its still so incredibly difficult for me to let things go.
- **set up MFA?** *Yup*, that's such an easy thing to do for how much confidence and security it provides. 
- **skip that optional meeting?** *Yup*, especially if it should have been an email.
- **turn on VIM keybinds?** *Yup*, how does anyone else work?
- **listen while you rubber duck a problem?** *Yup*, quack quack there's a race condition on line 42. 
- **be wearing shorts?** *Yup*, unless its a wedding or a funeral, my calves yearn for freedom like [the children yearn for the mines.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-children-yearn-for-the-mines)
