Here's how I prefer to talk to other humans, and why:

- I'm a big fan of chat/text message style communication. It is both asynchronous and informal, which is how I enjoy communicating
	- For people closest to me, that means text, FB messenger (yuck), discord, or slack
	- For work, that means MS Teams (also yuck) or Slack typically
- Second to that, I prefer email. I don't like the idea of broadcasting my any of my emails directly on my blog because of how sophisticated spam bots are these days, but I have a [[#Contact Form]] at the bottom of this page that if you leave your email I'll likely respond using that modality
- My plan is to write here on this site pretty consistently, and most posts should have a comment section that will only require a GitHub account to comment
- I'm not as active as I'd like to be on Mastodon, but you can find me on there at https://tldr.cam/mastodon
- I try not to spend a lot of time on [LinkedIn](https://tldr.cam/linkedin) because so much content just absolutely sucks, but I do keep up with messages on there, and would be happy to connect if you aren't selling something 
- For one-off technical questions or feedback or "rubber ducking" sessions I keep standing [office hours](https://tldr.cam/office-hours). If you request a slot, I ask that you put as much info as possible in the "Additional Notes" block. Requests from people I don't know that also don't have enough information in the additional notes slot will be declined. 
- I am on Facebook, but I hate using it and don't have it downloaded. I am really only on there to use messenger to stay in contact with my family and friends who aren't available anywhere else, so if you send me a friend request I probably won't see it.
- I have an Instagram that my wife made me years ago, but I don't think I've ever actually had the password to it and I really don't like pictures, so this is not a good spot to catch me either. 

If you get something that seems like it might be someone impersonating me, please check [[Verify]] or let me know through my [[#Contact Form]].

# Principals

I try to adhere to a few principals regarding my communication preferences:

## Prefer Asynchronous Communication
I *hate* meetings. I try very hard to avoid them, but I understand their inherent utility. Whenever given the option of synchronous vs asynchronous communication, I'll choose asynchronous 100% of the time. If I absolutely must engage in a meeting, my rules of thumb are:
	- I'm going to minimize the number of attendees invited to the meeting
	- I'll either write notes during the meeting or record it if everyone is okay with that
	- If I canâ€™t write up an agenda and a list of required objectives to send out beforehand , I will likely not create the meeting.

## Finite Keystrokes
Everyone has a [limited number of keystrokes](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes) they have left in the tank. It follows then that we should be optimizing for maximum effectiveness and minimum keystrokes. Therefore, I try to consider the best medium for what I intend to send. If it is something that I notice I've repeated to others, I'll typically opt for creating some type of shared document or blog post rather than a closed email chain or 1:1 chat. 

## No Hello
In the same vein of finite keystrokes and aligning with the [nohello](https://sbmueller.github.io/nohello/) idea, I promise not to be offended if you don't send me a greeting to preface your ask. Please, just fire away. I'm not the type to be upset if others do end up sending a greeting, because the purpose is to give the _asker_ permission to not send a greeting, not to blast them for doing so. So, go ahead and send away, greeting or otherwise.
