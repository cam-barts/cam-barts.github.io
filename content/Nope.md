# Will I...

- **watch that ad?** *Nope*, I'll do everything in my power to avoid doing so. ^d691df
- **turn on my camera for this meeting?** *Nope*, I built the machine I work on without a webcam for a reason. 
- **accept any cookies more than absolutely necessary to render your dumb site?** *Nope*, and if you force me to uncheck each the unnecessary ones, I'll probably leave your dumb site.
- **turn off my ad blocker for your dumb site?** *Nope*, bold of you to assume your dumb site warrants an exception.
- **sign up for your newsletter?** *Nope*, if I want to see your content, I'll subscribe to your RSS feed. Don't have one? Oof, I guess. 
- **create an account to read more?** *Nope*, I've rarely found content worth engaging in that I couldn't do so anonymously. Incognito, Wayback Machine, VPN, proxy sites like https://freedium.cfd/, and if none of those work, I'll assume you just deeply didn't want me to read it.
- **sign up for the paid, hosted version of your software?** *Nope*, because I enjoy [[Lab|Self Hosting]] and I like my data staying on my own machines whenever possible.  ^7a528a
- **give you my real email address?** *Nope*, I'll give you an alias that's tied to you, so that when you sell my data and I get emails from people who aren't you on that alias, I'll know your treachery and will stop providing you my business and attention.
- **download your app?** *Nope*, at least not just because you asked me to.
- **take a moment to fill out a brief survey?** *Nope*, unless I've explicitly opted into your alpha or beta program.
- **rate your app in the app store?** *Nope*, and I truly might have if you didn't nag me to do so.
- **use your authenticator app?** *Nope*, because I already have an app that provides RFC 6238 compliant TOTP, why would I want another one?
- **request a demo from your pricing page?** *Nope*, I'm on that page to see your pricing. If I wanted to request a demo, I'm confident I can manage navigating to your contact page. Companies who don't put their pricing on their pricing page give the same energy as companies who don't put the salary range on a job posting. 
- **schedule a meeting with you to "provide insight" on your groundbreaking new AI/SRE/DevOps tool?** *Nope*, just send me your docs and your pricing plan. If they exist and impress me, I'll reach back out to you. 
- **talk with your chatbot to get help?** *Nope*, please, I beg you, just let me read your docs or talk to a human.
- **ever have interest in monetizing this blog?** *Nope*, because it doesn't fit my [[Why]].
- **use SMS as my MFA method?** *Nope*, get with the times. It's not hard setting up TOTP. 
- **be interested in attending a corporate, [mando-fun](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Manditory+Fun+Day) event?** *Nope*, I'm all for collaboration but I'm allergic to artificial relationship building exercises. I have no desire to experience myself or others struggling to come up with an appropriate-for-the-occasion fun fact about themselves.
