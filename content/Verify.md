This document serves as a system of record for my online identities, inspired by [Molly White's](https://www.mollywhite.net/verify/) verify page. There are probably other places I exist, but either I'm not active on them or I don't wish to share publicly. If you are contacted by an account claiming to be me that isn't on this list, there's a good chance it's not actually me, but you can always [[Hello|ask]]!

# Domains

I control the following domains, so links to and emails coming from these domains are very likely to be me or from services I run. 

- coder.cam
- shadeking.cam
- tldr.cam


# GitHub

My GitHub account is https://github.com/cam-barts. I've gotten a lot better in recent years about ensuring all of my commits are signed, and I have enabled [Vigilant Mode](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits#about-vigilant-mode), so everything I push should be marked as verified.

This blog is hosted on GitHub actions in an open source repository, so whatever I'm writing on here should be pretty easily verified.
