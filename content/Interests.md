This list is my attempt to list out my interests in a style inspired by Chris Burnellâ€™s [/interests directory](https://chrisburnell.github.io/interests-directory). As with many pages in this blog, in the nature of [[index#What is a digital garden?|digital gardens]], I'll be updating this from time to time. Also, I expect to write about many of these, so I'll try to list the relevant tags as well. 

# Technology
I am a technologist by passion and by trade, so this shouldn't be too surprising. I'll talk about tech with anyone, and here are some of my favorite topics:
- SRE
- Automation
- Python
- #open-source 
- #homelab and #self-hosted
- POSSE
- Data Science
- Quantified Self
- "Maker" Culture
- Space Exploration

# Learning and Proficiency Building
Between [[About#Linux in the Fleet|getting to teach]] in the Marines, having the privilege of world class teachers and leaders, and becoming a part of the #obsidian community, understanding how people learn and how best to convey information has become a persistent interest of mine.
- Levels of Proficiency
- Skill building
- Teaching
- Mentoring
- Public Speaking
- Science Communication
- Personal Knowledge Management #pkm

# Discourse, Debate, and Changing My Mind
It's one of my personal philosophies that someone changing their mind in light of new information doesn't make that person wishy-washy or in any way discredits them. There are a million ways someone can be wrong or simply be convinced of an opposing argument. I certainly have my share of stances that have changed over the years. What I'm really interested in are how to craft great arguments and what mechanisms are used intentionally or unintentionally in bad arguments:
- Cognitive Biases
- Logical Fallacies
- Rhetoric
- Satire
- Behavioral Economics

# Leadership and Work Culture
Like most folks, I've had a mixed bag of absolutely excellent leaders and really terrible leaders in my life. I have a fascination with the characteristics of great leaders both in history and in my own experience, and thinking about how I might best apply those characteristics when I find myself in leadership roles. It is interesting to me how much satisfaction at work can be tied to the quality of leadership at different levels. I'm specifically interested in:
- The difference between leadership and management
- Sponsorship and advocacy
- Remote Work Culture and leaderships impact on it
- Hating on meetings that could have/should have been emails
- Optimally Balancing fostering collaboration and deep work/flow


# Media
No one would put me in the category of a movie buff or someone who is particularly well read. I was 30 before I watched any of the Star Wars movies for instance. I'm likely not going to be the best person for show recommendations, but there are a few common themes about the type of stuff I like. For example, I'm an absolute *sucker* for self sacrifice stories in any genre. Here are some of the things I have taken in that I'd love to talk about:

## Books
- Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams
- Mastery by Robert Greene
- Pop Psych
- Behavioral Economics
- Biographies

## Movies
- Mad Max: Fury Road
- Tombstone
- Lion King

## Shows
- There are a few doctor shows I love:
	- MASH
	- The Good Doctor
	- House
- Game of Thrones
- Letterkenny
- Shoresy


# Odds and Ends
These are also interests of mine that didn't fit squarely in the other categories:
- Stoicism (But not "bro-stoicism")
- Autism/ADHD/Neurodivergence
- Financial Literacy
